Here we are winding our way through beautiful woods and farming country till reaching the Rockies at Revelstoke up and up we climed  round and round these magnificent mountains. I sat most of the time in the observation Car platform most of the time alone, I was not sorry that others preferred the inside for some how it seemed all the ore beautiful when I was alone, people will chatter so, I did enjoy however meeting them all later on inside and in the dining room there we could talk it over. We arrived at Baniff 10-40 P. M. went to the Mount Royal Hotel thoroughly tired out.
