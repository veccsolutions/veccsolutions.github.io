Arrived in Chicago 9-15 A. M. met at the Michigan Central Station by Tindalls sister, Mrs Wynn Topint the most enjoyable day with her. Just she took me to Sears Robuck &amp; Co. They were all dressed up in their holliday regalia celebrating their 75th anniversary, we saw the rooms done in the period furniture most attractive to me was the one exactly like our old drawing room in England, Met Dr. Evans had lunch with him at the club, after which we took a most delightful drive for three hours arriving at the depot to catch the 5-40 train for Montreal, there comes to the end of another perfect day.
