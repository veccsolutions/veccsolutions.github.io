Looking up in the morning I looked out of the window and there beheld the most beautiful scenery so up I jumped and after a cup of coffee went straight to the platform and there I sat wrapped up in it all till eleven oclock, then I wrote to Harriett and a postal to Nora & Lucy. lunched and out to the platform again till bed time.
