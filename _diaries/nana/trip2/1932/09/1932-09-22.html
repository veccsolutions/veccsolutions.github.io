Left Detroit on buss it was hard to say good bye to the dearest daughter in the world&dash;what a happy time we did have together and dear little Junior too&dash;went over the Ambassador bridge and into Canada&dash;there on through to Niagara where we saw the Falls at night with the lights turned on them&dash;a glorious sight it was then on to &quot;Buffalo&quot; where we had dinner as a buss was just starting out&dash;I decided take it and go on to Serycuse, arriving there at 4&dash;am. Had a cup of coffee &amp;
