Sent cards to Lucy &amp; H. called up Lizzie Grant&dash;took a taxie out there, had not seen her or her husband Redge [unreadable] for 40 years. We had breakfast then talked and talked after a time Quincy and Isabel came and we did have such a good time. We all went out to Lizzies daughter for drinks a lovely place in the outskirts of Syricuse.
