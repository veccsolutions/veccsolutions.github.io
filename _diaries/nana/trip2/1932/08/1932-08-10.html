Arrived Salt Lake 5&dash;30 am slept till 11&dash;am. Went to hear organ recital at Temple 12 noon then out to Salt Air. Had a dollar dinner after a swim in the lake&dash;was terribly disappointed in the lake. Poor excuse of a one. Dancing till 11&dash;Martha was kind enough to dance a waltz with me&dash;and I did enjoy it&dash;of course more than she did.
