Went to busses, bought a book for each of the children and sent it with a letter, took a great deal of pleasure in doing that little thing. Walked down 5<sup>th</sup> Ave never saw so many beautifully dressed or rather well dressed women in my life&dash;talk about hard times. The Ave was crowded and really I was the only poorly dressed one on it. Thatâ€™s the truth, but I enjoyed just the same, there is no style like style, could only spend 20cts on my meals today.
