Archibald came and we went to &quot;The little church around the corner.&quot; Just a block from the Hotel the Music was so beautiful I was so thankful to be able to go. Then A. and I went to Dinner, Childs Special all I can afford and only one a day, then to the Art Museum. Hurt my knee Saturday, very painful hard to get around but went just the same, came home had tea &amp; toast then listened to the radio. At 9oclock Archibald went home he is a fine boy and I enjoyed [t]his day very much.
