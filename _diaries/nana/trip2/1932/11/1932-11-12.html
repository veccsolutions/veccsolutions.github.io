Eirly I took my little twenty&dash;five dollars it seemed a lot to hand over to the Registry but decided it was the only thing to do&dash;they were sure they could place me in the work I like by Wednesday&dash;18<sup>th</sup> so let us hope. Then I took a note out to Cornell University and left it there for Archibald Cashion who is studing law there, I had no sooner reached the hotel again when he called me up seemed so glad to know I was here and promised to come and go to church with me Sunday.
