Phoned call from the Child Training Institute to go on Interview Dr. Van Arden 47 E 66<sup>th</sup> of course I was thrilled to death and started off never dreamed I would not get the work taking charge of an Infant at 80 dollars per month. I was disappointed he took a younger nurse a German, well I am not discouraged yet tho I have been at the Hotel nearly a week.
