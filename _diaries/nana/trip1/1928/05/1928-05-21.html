Got off eirly to New York, a beautiful day so took the Buss thro the New Tunnel. (Oh&mdash;I first went to the dressmakers tried on my white dress, looks very nice.) bought 2 pair hoes in Lord &amp; Taylors pair gloves white wash--$200.00 and a lovely dress of Orgnig [Orange?] with such pretty flowers (sent off Harrietts box, for her birthday) in it&mdash;one pink &amp; other yellow to take to the girls&mdash;had luncheon in &quot;Sack&#39;s a good one it was too. Took the 42nd St car drove to Ferry and a ride across to [unreadable], then some shopping,--little things, a lunch or rather tea, had tickets for the New Amsterdam Theatre, so got there rather eirly and rested, never enjoyed a Musical comedy more, A Ziegfeld production it was&mdash;&quot;Marilyn Miller&quot; with Jack Donahue.
