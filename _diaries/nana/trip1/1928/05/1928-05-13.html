Had our toast &amp; coffey in bed but got to church by 11-oclock, the little church around the corner,&quot; Oh-The music there was more beautiful than any thing I have ever heard, the most wonderful boys choir, and boy solo and the church itself was charming, after dinner we went to the Penn Station, took a train to Long Island &quot;Forest Hills Hotel,: and on to Jemaica. Arriving back in N.Y. in time for dinner and catch the train for Chappaquac where I said goodbye to Blanch here endith a very pleasant weekend. Arriving home at 9-30.
