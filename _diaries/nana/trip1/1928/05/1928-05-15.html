My check day end of the 4th month of work, the very unpleasant task of telling Mrs D. I must leave her in two weeks. She was very much upset, called up Mr Dwyre&mdash;he came rushing home offering me every inducement to stay, I told them I must go, &quot;and not to worry, we would get someone I would break her in before I left and everything would go smoothly.
