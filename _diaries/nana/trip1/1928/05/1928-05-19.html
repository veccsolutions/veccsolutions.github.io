Letter from Hattie, Mrs Anderson, looked for one from Lucy dear old girl she is so faithful with her letters do miss it when a week goes by without one. Interviewed several nurses to take my place a French girl, seemed possibly others. Not so much so, hope by tomorrow someone will come who we really like, Weather very bad for babies!! Rainy all the time but oh so lovely &amp; green the trees are.
