Got off by 11 oclock met Blanch in the Grand Central First we went to luncheon at Sack-then did a little shopping. I bought the white goods for my dress, that Mrs [blank] is to make for me, candy for Grandma &dash; could not get tickets for the show we liked, so I bought one for the following Monday. My feet just pained so we got into a sightseeing buss and went to China town, a dreadful &quot;holdup&quot; it was, paid one dollar, and then another 50 cts to see absolutely not one thing new. We laughed about it any way. Blanch said, &quot;I told you so.&quot; &amp; so did George, - but still I insisted on going. After that we had a good dinner, I forget the place &quot;special chicken dinner&quot; just off sixth street on 32nd, then we went to Roxey&#39;s Threatre saw a very good &quot;vaudeville&quot;, not so good picture, &quot;The Hangmans House&quot;, We had to pick up our grip at the station OK I forgot to say, before I left the theater I was a obliged to take off my shoes to get relief, and much to Blanch disgust, I could not get them on again, and had to carry them out in my hand to the dressing room we had a lot of fun over it anyway. Got into a taxi and to the Martha Washington Hotel we went, Past midnight, Finally got settled slept till ten Sunday
