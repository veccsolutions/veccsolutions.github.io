Left for New York at noon attended to sleeper reservations and bought 2 pair of stockings, and a piece of lace for cuffs, felt just exhausted and extremely lame, pain I do not like in knee so came to the Martha Washington Hotel and registered for the night. Made a little bag for Grandma, Handersyne to take to her tomorrow.
