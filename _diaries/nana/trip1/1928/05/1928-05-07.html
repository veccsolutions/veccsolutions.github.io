Got off 11 A.M. for the day in New York. First, I went to see about my return trip, engaged stateroom on the &quot;Morris&quot; leaving June 2nd. Bought a dark blue umbrella very nice one, at Sacks&quot; 5th Ave, went to the bank, 2nd &amp; 14th St. had lunch, a lot of small errands, large string of pearls restrung &amp; etc. very tired so took the car back and went to the Car[xx]o Theatre, just around the corner form home. In by 10-30.
