Quite cold today looks like snow Stayed in the house, enjoyed looking over Hatties scrap books. Very interesting, also her many interesting poems &amp; etc reminiscing Hattie remembers the things she wants to all right and her mind is a wonder, she got lunch and dinner at home, would not let me do anything to help. Sidney too busy at the bank to even get home to meals, one afraid he is over doing, not what you would call young any more, seems valuable to the Bank, and a kind good husband &amp; brother in Law.
