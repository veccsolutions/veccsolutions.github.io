Ha, Ha&mdash;had a call from a very particular lady must have New York references &amp; etc. I did not want her ten month old child any. I will only take infant work any, Hunted up a child specialist, Dr. Kerby and he sent me to Dr Geo L. Broadhead and Dr H. Halstead. I saw them both Dr. Halsted knew Dr Coffey well, so I felt my problem was settled and soon I would get to work, so what did I do, went right and bought tickets for the Metropolitan for two, four dollars each I paid for them in the very top of the house. I know this extravagant never again will I be able! Oh such a great treat. I phoned to Marion Laird she came spent the night, got a cab, oh my dear we went in style we both dressed in our best. &quot;Tosca&quot; the wonderful opera sung by Jeritza, the greatest of all [unreadable] of the this day. Lotta as Baron Scapia, and who I liked better, Mario Cavaradossi. It was a night of pleasure that will go with me to the grave, I am all alone in this world is a way I am, can&#39;t I make companions worth while, can&#39;t afford even a home. It may be wrong to spend money this way, but I can&#39;t see it.
