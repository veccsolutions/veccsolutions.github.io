Up by 8-30 packed my trunk got all ready then went out had a god breakfast then to the Bannk, paid my bill took a buss to the New York Central Station caught the 12-15 N.Y. Central train to Poughkeepsie arriving there at 3 a.m. checked my grip, looked about for a room, and found one three blocks from Hatties, then I called them up and informed them I was here all settled in a room. They could not understand that way of doing, however it proved most satisfactory. I had a good nap then went up to see them I found Sidney home too and Oh! What a dear sweet house they have, all the comforts of life and lots of very handsome and some old things had a lovely evening.
