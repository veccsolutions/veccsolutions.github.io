Still snowing and very cold had meals in Hotel and waited in room. Hoping to be called every minute on a case. By night, after writing to Hattie, Isabell Grant and the girls, put on my heavy clothes and went to hear a Special &quot;All-Wagner&quot; program at the Metropolitan Opera House. Pretty heavy &quot;Wagner&quot; is all in keeping with my feelings however &quot;home-sick&quot; I might call it today&mdash;love to see my girls all 4 of them, must stay my nine months, and get the full benefit of the change.
