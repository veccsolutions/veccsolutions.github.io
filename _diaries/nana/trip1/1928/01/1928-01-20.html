Still cold off for a car ride to Vasa College. Walked all around then transferred to the Hudson River State Hospital where after viewing the buildings and the glorious view from the top of the hill, happened to ask if visitors were admitted in the building, to which they replied, I think you can, so they phoned and got a guide, who took me all over it seemed very sad to see all those people shut up in there, some of them seemed happy an contented enough, and certainly well cared for. A great institution, he called my attention to a man who was determined to stand in front of the looking glass the day I was there they had decided to cover it with a sheet, thinking perhaps to break him of the habit, but no, there he stood just he same and never even turned to look at the door where we stood, talking about him. Home just in time for dinner, amused them all telling of my experience.
