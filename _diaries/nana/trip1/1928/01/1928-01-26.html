Had coffee &amp; toast sent up 45 cts Never again. Started out 1230 to find work. With Dr Coffeys and Mrs Hermans splendid letters thought it would be an easy task, but not so easy. To three Drs I went Dr James Hoyt Kerby 72 E 91st. Dr Chas Gilmore Kerby 132 W 91st had a good walk thro the park from one &quot;Kerby&quot; to the other. Then to Dr. George L. Broedhead 46 West 53 St. Felt rather discouraged so put an add in the Sunday paper. Had dinner an went to one of the best shows, a Comedy &quot;The Royal Family&quot; showing up the live of the Texxxxxtal Cavendish Family, Haidee Wright as Fanny Cavendish. Ann Andrews as Julia Cavendish, and Otta Kruger as Antony Cavendish. Enjoyed it very much
