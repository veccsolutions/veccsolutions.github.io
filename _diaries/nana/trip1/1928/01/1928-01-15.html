Up in time for Church but went to the wrong one, St Pauls instead of Christschurch. Met Sidney and Hattie after and had dinner with them had such a nice time Sidney showing me a lot of family Silver and other things, so much to talk about. Tea with the old china one very dear set Hattie said should belong to Lucy at Hatties death.
