Walked to Smiths College Club to get mail heard from Maud, Lucy, International Trust Co, Deed for Cemetery lot in Denver, Duplicate. Shopped for Maud bought [unreadable] set 50 dollars at Lord &amp; Taylors. Silk Kemona and [unreadable] at Franklin Simons and had them sent. As I was eating luncheon it occored to me a very good time to go to Sheppiqua and get Blanch to write my business letters for me. So off I went to the (storming, terrific wind blowing) Grand Central, arriving there in an hour, walked up the hill in an other fifteen minutes and very much surprised they were, Alice had gone to her daughters in Philadelphia Grandma &amp; Blanch made it very pleasant for me, Grandma was on her good behavior, and had a good time, they persuaded me to stay all night, Marion came home and we all played Bridge.
