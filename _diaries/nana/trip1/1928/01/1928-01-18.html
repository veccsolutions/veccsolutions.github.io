Ten oclock Miss Scheltz came to take me for a delightful ride in her sedan, all around Vasa College grounds, then on along the River drive beautiful scenery of mountains and vallies, lunch with Hattie at home, read and sewed and caller came at three invited to have tea with her and go to a lecture at Vasa.
