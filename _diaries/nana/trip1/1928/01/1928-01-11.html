Got out early this morning took a 5th Ave Buss along West Front drive to 125gh St took the Fort Lee Ferry boat across the Hudson to Jersey city Long Island, then down to Cortland St on the &quot;Elevated&quot; took the Ferry down the Hudson to Weehauky, two very enjoyable boat rides, seeing the large liners resting and getting done over for their next voyage. The Majestic sails Saturday at Midnight; Felt like buying a ticket over right off, but decided to wait a while. Wrote to Lucy, Hattie and Mr Bond of the International Trust Co. to ask if there was any report on Tuds Estate. Saw Warnemakers Line
