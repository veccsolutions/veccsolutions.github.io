Went to Christs Church heard Dr Singer, we all had a cozy breakfast, at home, went out for dinner, after which I took a long walk up Vasa hill. A gentleman at the boarding house told me about the walk, and would have liked to go with me, but I should have had to talk and could not have enjoyed the wonderful view and air half so much as I did when alone. I sat there for an hour, just gazing on the beautiful Hudson and Katskill Mountains. Cozy tea at home with Sidney &amp; Hattie.
