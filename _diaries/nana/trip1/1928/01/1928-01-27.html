Stayed in all day hoping for a phone call to go to work. Sewed and mended wrote to Harriett and read &quot;The Medea of Euripides&quot; anything but a cheerful book to read just when I feel a little discouraged for I am spending money I should be keeping for my old age, if it happens to be my lott to live after I am unable to work, but please may God spare me this.
