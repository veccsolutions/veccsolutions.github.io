Went to St Thomas&#39; Church 5th Ave and E I st, there we saw the real class out in their Glory I enjoyed seeing them all, Rev Roclef H Brooks preached a splendid sermon and the choir of 100 voices are all mostly boys was indeed a pleasure after that we went into the big Catholic Cathedral on 5th Ave and saw the end of their services then we got on the Broadway car and went down took the Ferry over to Stratton Island a good twenty minutes ocean ride for 5.00 we came right back to the city had a good dinner then saw Blanch off on the 5-15 train and was sorry to see her go. Went to my room took a bath and to bed I went all tired out. Got up again t use a ticked I had for the opera concert at eight-thirty, there I heard the wonderful Metropolitan orchestra again and Gerte Starckgold in &quot;Aida&quot; I simply went just crazy with the rest of the audience.
