Up by 7-30 packed my grip down to breakfast, my last breakfast with Hattie &amp; Sidney, called a cab, said good-bye, this brings to the end a most delightful visit, one that I shall ever remember, arrived in New York 4-20, phoned to Smith College only to find they could not let me have a room, but allowed me to keep my headquarters there, trunk &amp; etc till hey did have one, so I went to the Martha Washington Hotel, am comfortable and more centrally located, but of course environment not so pleasant.
