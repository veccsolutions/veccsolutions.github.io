Terribly tired but must make the most of our time so took a 5th Ave bus down Riverside drive to General Grant Monument a most beautiful it was. Past the homes of John D Rockefellow, John Jacob Astor, and others, getting off at the Metropolitan Art Museum, the most wonderful collection we spent all afternoon there, we were both glad to get into bed and slept till 10 o&#39;clock of the morning of Jan 6 1928
