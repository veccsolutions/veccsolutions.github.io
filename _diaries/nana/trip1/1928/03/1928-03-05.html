Had such a nice day in N. Y. First sent Betty June her little dress, then to St Thomas Church for the Midday Service, Lunch, then took a 5th Ave buss, along Riverfront drive as far as the New Medical Hospital center at 168th coming back I got off went thro the Natural Museum at 158th &amp; Broadway. Also hopped in to a most interesting old church, &quot;The Chapel of Intercession.&quot;  At 155th &amp; Broadway. Altogether spent a most satisfactory day arriving back in Jersey City by 9-30.
