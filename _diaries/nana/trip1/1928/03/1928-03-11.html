Yes!!! And I spent a very pleasant considering I am so far away from those I love so dearly and no letters from them, all forget it takes so long for letters. Mrs Dwyre gave me a beautiful lace collar, and Mr D a box of candy. Very nice of them. Went to church in the morning had company for dinner very pleasant altogether.
