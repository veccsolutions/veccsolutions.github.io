Out for the day. First I had my hair-dressed during that operation, went sound asleep in the chair. Felt fine after that, thought I would surprise the girls with a photograph so up I went and had my beautiful self taken, expect they will be terrible, will tear them up if they are, paid my two life insurances. Had another long buss ride dinner, home by 8-30. found a lovely box of candy sent by Lucy for my Birthday it having journeyed around after me nearly two weeks.
