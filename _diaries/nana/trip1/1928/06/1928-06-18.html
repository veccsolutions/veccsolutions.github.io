Slept until late Flo &amp; Claud called me to say good-bye to Claud, 7-30 had a good breadfast and washed out my cool dress then packed up, called up everyone to say Good bye. Then a taxi, where Flo, Louie went with me to the depot, there Violet joined us with a beautiful basket of fruit from them all. We got permission for them all to go thro the gates and they stayed till the train pulled out at 4-20 lovely of them dear old Friends. The sleeper was rather crowded but I settled myself down and slept five oclock. Had a trout dinner at six, then to bed.
