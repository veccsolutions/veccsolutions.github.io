After breakfast we all got together a good lunch and instead of going to church we went for a picknic, It was my only chance, so I pray Almighty God to forgive us, Never was there a more beautiful day&mdash;not too hot nor too cold, we got as far as Morrisson&mdash;turned off up a road leading to the prettiest spot by the side of a spring there we had our lunch, Lecie&mdash;Claud&mdash;Flo&mdash;Violet &amp; [blank]. After we climed about awhile Louie the same as of old, all going over old times and having such a good time. Just as we used to do, in days gone by. The we all got into the car and started out over the mountains stopping every once in a while to enjoy the smell of the pines. We arrived home by 9-30, never enjoyed anything more in all my life.
