Started out Eirley, sent off a corset cover to Hattie cost me 50.00 then went to the International Trust Co. [2 words unreadable]. Saw the manager of the trust division Mr. Holbrook. Feel just satisfied with the way he is handling the estate, came back to the Hotel in time to receive Mrs Fuller, the same old Mrs Fuller, surely did seem good to see her again. It was pouring with rain so we had lunch in the Hotel, then just talked till, to our surprise we found it was five oclock, she rushed off to get her dinner and I rushed upstairs to change my dress and tidy up. Then walked up 17th St to Humboldt then to Mrs Caspars where in the [morning] Flora had invited me to dinner, I found the whole family there Floras girl, a nice golden haired type just 15 years, and her son just out of his first year in Boulder University; we had lovely evening together after a delicious dinner, Oh yes!!!! I forgot to say a very old friend Mrs Mason was there too, Flora having invited her to meet me it was such a pleasure to see here again, We talked and talked over everything that had happened. At about nine oclock They drove us home or rather up to Flo&#39;s in their nice new Packard. Flo and Claud was there to greet me soon went to bed
