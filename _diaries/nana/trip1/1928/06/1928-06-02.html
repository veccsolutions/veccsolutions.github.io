Said goodbye to my dear little baby, Never was a better one. But I am leaving her in good hands. Mrs Dwyer gave me a new book the Bridge of San Lous Bay by Thornton Wilder. They certainly have been exceedingly kind and appreciative. But I had to say good bye. They driving me to the train where went to the Courtland St. Ferry, then a Taxy to the Southern Pacific Rail. Promptly at 12-45 our boat &quot;[unreadable]&quot; sailed away out New York bay, a beautiful sight passing the Statue of Liberty. Then I turned my attention to my stateroom No 16 and found a most delightful girl &quot;Miss Tucker&quot; as my companion. It did not take us long to get things straightened out and ourselves made comfortable, then we got our deck chairs well cushioned, and settled down to solid comfort. On we sailed out into the broad Atlantic. I never enjoyed anything in all my life. Dinner time came, my  seat was No 16, table 9&mdash;I soon got acquainted with a Mr &amp; Mrs Hallis who sat across from me such delightful people on their way to visit a daughter in Tucson , after the delicious dinner we got a third lady a most charming woman&mdash;Mrs Townsley from Newark N.J. we all got together in the Lounge room and played a game of Bridge.
