Everyone up by 5 oclock, so beautiful along the winding river, water very muddy, but Oh- how many spring flowers &amp; shrubs all in bloom. For the last time the musich dong called us to breakfast this time at six, only fruit coffee &amp; rolls then we found everyone with outstretched hands waiting as it were for &quot;tips&quot;&mdash;I limited myself to five dollars which I had paid out as soon as I got on the boat&mdash;one to the waiter one to the steward the room steward deck hand &amp; bell boy. Everyone was out on deck to watch our dear boat wind it&#39;s way along till it finaly reach the New Orleans dock. Then such a shaking of hands and good-byes. Mrs Townsly and I had arranged to see New Orleans together so off we went waving good bye to the dear old ship not without regret, We took a cab to Hotel Roosevelt there I got my sleeper tickets, already reserved, arranged for a sight seeing trip wired to Harriet &amp; to the Shirley Hotel Denver then had breakfast in the R. Grill after which started out in a &quot;Packard&quot; to see New Orleans, riding for over two hours seeing all the parts of interest amongst which were the haunts of the famous Napoleon House &quot;John McDonough residence&quot; St. Louis Cathedral, Grand Route St. John City park The French Market, &quot;the Dueling oaks,&quot; Delgado Museum. Beautiful [xxxtaires] Cemetery where many notables were buried. Spanish fort St Charles Ave Sea Monument. A delightful trip it was. Regretted very much not being able to go to the French restaurant for dinner, just caught my train for Denver 12-2. It was a terribly hot day, and the sleeper was close and stuffy after the glorious sea breeze, however there were very few on the sleeper, and that was a blessing. On we went thro prosperous country crossing the Mississippi several times, the most marvelous thing was the time our train was just cut in half as it were and double it up on a tug boat, and over we sailed across as easily as could be A very nice old lady had a seat opposite me, so we decided to not go in the diner but have our tea and toast brought in
