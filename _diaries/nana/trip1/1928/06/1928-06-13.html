Got out eirly went to the Denver to try to get a corset cover for Hattie &amp; to see about my sleeper. Find I am obliged to go home by way of San Francisco. Came back to the Hotel found Mr Gillpatric here and Flo came later we started right out to &quot;Eliches Gardens,&quot; just the same old place, very beautiful at this time of year, rather cold, but we had a lot of fun and just to be able to tell the girls we, all went on the Merry go round and the train then we walked all around and enjoyed the flowers. At six we had dinner in the new dining room. Mr Giles treat, and a treat it surely was too. A wonderful dinner eat too much. Then we saw them dance, and came back by 11.30.
