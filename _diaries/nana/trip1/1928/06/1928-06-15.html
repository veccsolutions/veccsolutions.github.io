Got up, not till 10 clock just looked around till about 12 oclock, then we went to town and to the bank, after that took a car out to Fairmount Oh! It was so beautiful out there, the graves were well cared for and all was beautiful, but&mdash;after I put flowers on the graves we had to leave them because the mosketoes were dreadful, would have eaten us all up. We hunted up Clauds car and sat in that till he was ready to take us home. Ten we had a good dinner after which we walked up to Joy&#39;s had a visit with her then home to bed. I am writing this in the Pulman three days later hence the bad writing.
