Had enough energy to venture twice around the boat for exersize just poked along up to this time wrote to Lill, Hattie, Mrs Dwyre Maud, Nona and cards to Lucy, Harriet, Martha &amp; etc. Also wrote to the Lairds &dash;altogether ten oclock we reached the mouth of the Mississippi and every one was interested in seeing the Searchlights as we approached we were met by the pilot who escourted into and up to the river, it was all very interesting and a thing I have never seen before.
