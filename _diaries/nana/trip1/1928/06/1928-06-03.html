Got out on deck by 5, AM after a good nights sleep. Just Heavenly, &quot;Rocked in the cradle of the deep&quot;, just sleepy all the time not a care in the world. The Stewards had my salt bath ready at 6-30, then back to bed for another snooze, and up for breakfast!! All eat too much, dozed all day till night came, then bridge again.
