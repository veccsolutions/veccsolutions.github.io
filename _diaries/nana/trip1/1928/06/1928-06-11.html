Flo called up at 8-A. M. Said she was coming right down so just rested until she came&mdash;Oh yes, I washed a lot of stockings &amp; things and pressed my dresses, then she came in about eleven and we just talked &amp; talked, then we got dressed &amp; went out down 16th to D &amp; F. Oh!!&dash;what small country stores these do seem. Took my glasses to be mended &amp; had lunch at Teholtzs tea room, then went up to the Denver after that took a car home with Flo, she has a nice little bungalow on Addams St, there she insisted on my resting till she got dinner. Claud came in 6-30, and we all had a good time. After dinner we walked up to Joy&#39;s saw them all there, then they put me on the car and to bed by 11 oclock.
