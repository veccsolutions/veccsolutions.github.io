Arrived at San Francisco 8-45 Just in time for breakfast after which caught the 9-45 train for home. Ocourse I became very anxious to see them all. Was met at Glendale station by Harriett Jerome, and the dear children. Oh such a home coming, They all looked so well and prosperous. Good car &amp; etc. drove me to their home 414 Niagara St Burbank, such a nice house with a room all to myself&mdash;I went to sleep full of thankfulness for one of the dearest daughters in the world, looking forward to seeing Lucy &amp; family on the morrow&mdash;it was not her falt that they could not meet me.
