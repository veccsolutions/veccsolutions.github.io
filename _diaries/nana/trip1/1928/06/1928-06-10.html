Oh!! How different the air seemed as soon as we crossed over the Colorado the air from the Rocky Mountains, never was such air, I was awake going over the old scenes &quot;Pueblo,&quot; where my Harriet was born&mdash;then Colorado Springs where, The &quot;Old&quot; Antlers Hotel where we spent our Honeymoon It all brought back many memories. Arrived in Denver at 12-10. Took a Taxi to Savoy Hotel there I tidied my self up, and called up Flo, also Mrs Gil. They were out, so I had drive them took a car up to Humboldt St walked past the old home, I found both the houses were rented, dropped in a minute to see Mrs Casper, just the same as ever at 88, walked down Colfax to the Hotel, got my things out called up Mrs Gillpatric, she said she was coming down to the Hotel, which she did and spent the evening. Got to bed by eleven.
