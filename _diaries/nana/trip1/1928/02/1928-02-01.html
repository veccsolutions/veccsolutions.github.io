Started out to the Home Bureau where Dr Halsted gave me letters of introduction; saw Miss King who seemed to be impressed with me, she called a lady on Stratton Island, I talked to her she has a three month old baby she wants to turn over to me, she is to let me know tomorrow at ten. Was so pleased with the prospects I went to lunch at Millards 46th &amp; Madison Ave terribly expensive but oh so good, and class, I should say so, bought two wash clothes and a hat on sale for one dollar, a ribbon to trim it with feel real dressed up, looked around at the pretty things in the Art Dpt. Oh!! And bought material for Dorothy&#39;s dress. Had Ice cream at Allice McDougles 57 St between 5th &amp; 6th Ave. spent enough for one day so came home wrote to Harriett, beautiful weather again just like spring. Haven&#39;t a thing to read.
