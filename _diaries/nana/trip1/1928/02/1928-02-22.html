Took the Baby to the Dr H C Coroles, thoruly examined, in fine shape. Went through the famous tunnel, a wonderful piece of engineering, two tunnels right under the Hudson one going and other coming just for Auto, all lined with white tiling, and well lighted the charge a toll of 50 for each auto, had a good nap when I got back.
