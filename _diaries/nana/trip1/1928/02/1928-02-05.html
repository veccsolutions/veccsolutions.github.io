Go up and was dressed at 7 a.m. Thought I would get a cup of coffee and skip off, before they heard me but of course say goodbye to them all in bed but nothing doing, they all got up had breakfast together, then took me to the station, Arrived in New York at 12 oclock, went right and had my trunk checked through to Staton Island, then took the Elevated railway to the South Ferry where the boat sailed for Staton Island, arriving there at 2.30. Mrs Newhouse met me and took me to the house, a good fifteen minute ride from the ferry. There I found the baby that was to be my charge, a dear fine boy he is two &amp; half months old. Everything is of course strange but all will adjust itself in a few day I know it will be hard to be tied in, after a whole year doing just as I like, but it has to be.
