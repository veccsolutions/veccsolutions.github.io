Had a good start today first to the Bank, mail, letter from Harriett, checked out of the Hotel after seeing the manager and thanking him for the very curteous treatment received by all the employees, they called me a cab, and off I went to catch the 2-20 train for Chappaqua, to spend two days with the Lairds, who should I meet but George Laird just as I was having a little lunch in the Depot, it was so very nice to have him all the way up. Alice met us. Spent such a pleasant evening with them, bridge after a good home made cocktail and dinner.
