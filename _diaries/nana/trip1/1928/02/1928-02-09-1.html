Had a letter from Lucy surely did give me the homesick feeling; but there is no use I mean to stay in the east and see all I can of it, till my ticket runs out, my girls don&#39;t need me any way they have their husbands and children, I have not anyone, but I did have them for a long time. That&#39;s why I miss them so.
