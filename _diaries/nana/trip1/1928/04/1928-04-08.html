Woke up hearing the bells ringing the birds and all sounded so beautiful thro the open windows but--, could not get up, just tired out, so slept &amp; slept knowing it was right thing to do when I had a chance, first time after 9 weeks eirly infant calls for bottle and care almighty God know how tired I was. Up in time for dinner then a great walk to get a flower for Mrs Handyside 90 years old March 1st. It gave her pleasure just visited till they took me to the train at 5 oclock after a delightful sweet rest, arriving in New Jersey &amp; home 9-30. No letter from the girls, mail all late, so of course went to bed very sad.
