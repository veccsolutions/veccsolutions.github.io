Thanksgiving day, Never was there spent a more delightful one. Robin Elsie and the boy David came to dinner. Martha cooked the turkey and vegetables Elsie brought the pudding and Cranberries, and I mead the pie, mince and apple. We did not forget to say &quot;grace&quot; thanking Almighty God for all his goodness to us, then to bring to the end of a perfect day, came a telegram from the girls just at six oclock. I went to my room and wrote them, then said my prayers and to sleep.
