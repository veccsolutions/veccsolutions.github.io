All got up early to catch the 9-30 train, for we had to say goodbye to Hattie and Sidney. I went to Boston with them and across to the South Station where they took the train to Poughkeepsie, I went around Boston a little then came home, the house surely did seem gloomy without them so I put in two hours practicing. every day the greatest treat I ever had in all my life.
