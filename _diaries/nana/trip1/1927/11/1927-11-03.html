Got up rather early for me as a rule I never stir till 8-30. had my bath and dressed at nine. went to the Nurses Registry to see about getting a case. They told me they could put me to work very soon. After lunch I went to Robinsons and Elsies spent the afternoon and had dinner, then they brought me home.
