Out of bed and dressed in time to go to Trinity Church Boston for once I wished I may be rich just to sit in those very comfortable pews, and kneel on those soft cushions every Sunday. Oh those boys!! how they did sing, heavenly! heard a good Sermon on the practical side of living stayed for Communion. In the afternoon I went to Maltapan to see Mrs Neagle, had a delightful visit and a delicious tea, insisted on my staying till the last car, tired out.
