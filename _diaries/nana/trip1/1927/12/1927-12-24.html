Went into Boston with Martha had dinner, sent my small offering to the poor, then up Beacon Hill we went, visited the Diocus house No 1 Joje St Met Bishop Sturges, had delightful time, after which we walked up and down Beacon Hill looking at all the curious homes old and handsome, on every corner were groups singing Christmas carols the sweetest thing and the greatest pleasure I have had of its kind, lovely, lovely. I shall never forget how beautiful it all was, we did not get home until very late, and it was so cold, but George had hot Chocolate ready, then we opened the pac. from the girls, presents for all from them all at home and a pac. from my dear sister Maud, with a check in it for ten dollars
