Left on the 10-25 train for New York. Martha accompanied me. It is with regret that I leave the old home, I have spent a most peaceful three months, George and Martha most exceedingly kind. And when I said goodbye I felt very sad but Martha being with me kept things going, and the trip was enjoyable. Arriving at the New York Central Station at 5.30 P.M. Straight to the Smith College club we went and got two very comfortable rooms together. I was tired so went to bed after a good bath, much to Martha&#39;s disgust.
