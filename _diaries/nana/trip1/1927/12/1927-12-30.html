Had Breakfast in our bedroom but managed to get down to the Grand Central Station to catch the 10-5 train for Chappaqua! Where we had a invitation to spend the day with the Lairds. Alace met us at the depot and took us up to the house about a mile over a pretty winding road. There we met her daughter Marion, sister Blanch and old Mrs Hauthside. The old lady is a great care to them all, 88 years old very well physically but nearly gone mentally, however it is there duty to care for her like she cared for them when children, now she is a child again, it is very sad tho. Marion is a delightful girl and so is George a splendid fellow. He came home at [noon]. We had a most delicious luncheon and visit talking over everybody and everything, and caught the four o&#39;clock train back, after promising to return the following day.
