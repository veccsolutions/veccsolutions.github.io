Saw Martha off on the 12.30 train for home, then came back to the club and packed and caught the 4 o&#39;clock train for Chappaqua, Marion met me, after dinner we had such a good time playing and dancing the New Year in, but I stopped long enough to pray for my girls every blessing and happiness would be theirs thro the year 1928 and fell asleep feeling confident almighty god would care for them all through the year as he as done in the past and keep them pure in heart.
