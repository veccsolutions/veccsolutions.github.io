Wrote to Mrs Herman, Lucy went to Boston got Christmas cards, sent a pac. To Maud and one to Margaret for her wedding present. Saw &quot;Loose Uncles&quot; a comedy. Laughed over it a lot. Began to read &quot;Ramona&quot; by Helen Hunt Jackson, thought I had read it long ago, having gone over every bit of the Ground so many times.
