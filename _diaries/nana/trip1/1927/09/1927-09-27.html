Visited Miss Harkers School for Girls, very old fashened, dark and gloomy, found Miss Harker extremely pleasant, and very splendid woman of the old school. had good lunch, English mutton chops the best since I left England, packed my grip and caught the 5-40 traine to San Francisco. Feeling sad to leave my dear sister Maud behind after crossing the bay to Oakland, by the light of the evening caught the 8-45 Southern Pacific train for Seattle.
