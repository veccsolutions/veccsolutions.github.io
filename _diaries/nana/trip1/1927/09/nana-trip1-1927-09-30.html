9-a. m. we sailed for Victoria on the Princess Catherine. A more beautiful morning could never be, sky as blue and clear, as the water on which we are sailing on both sides of the sound are the Islands of the beauty is indescribable every shade. Mrs Cooper Anderson an old friend met me in Victoria, she took me right to her home, after a good chat talking over the days dear to my heart spent together, during the years of 1895 and 1904 in Telluride. After a rest she took me for a walk where we had a beautiful view of the sea, on thro the park, where we watch the  Gentlemenâ€™s Bowling Green. After dinner we visited the Crystle Palace and the Empress Hotel, not any of the Hotels can compare with our American Hotels, a sort of untidiness about them but very good tings they do have to eat. excelant cooking and service. Tumbled in to bed at 12:30, slept till eight oclock in the morning of October 1st 1927
