The car was ready at 9-30 to take me to the Sunkin Gardens, these gardens are owned by a Mr Butcher who made a 
million dollars in the making of cement right on his own grounds the gardens are a beautiful combination of English
and Japanese landscaping and one could very pleasantly spend a whole day roaming over them. but my time was limited as
I had to catch the 1-45 boat for Vancouver, out of the harbor we slowly sailed while my friend waved her handkerchief
till we were out of sight. Arriving at Vancouver at 5-45 P. M. took a car for an hours drive leaving on the B.P.R.R. 9 P. .M.
