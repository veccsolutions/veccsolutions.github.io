Had a good nights sleep ready to jump out of bed at 7.a.m Arrived at San Jose 7-45, left there 7-55 on the local arrived Palo-Alto 9.a.m. where Maud met me, we went straight to her Hotel, The Cardinal where we had breakfast and a good visit. In the afternoon went to see Betty at her school, &quot;Castillya School for girls&quot;, poor child we found her very unhappy, she could not bear the thought of parting with her Mother, who was only to be in Palo Alto another week shut up in a boarding school as it were, did not agree with the sweet, delicate nature of Betty Evans. We tried to help her arrange her room and make it look comfortable but all she said was &quot;I want to go home with Mother,&quot; so we left her that day. had our dinner and to bed early.
