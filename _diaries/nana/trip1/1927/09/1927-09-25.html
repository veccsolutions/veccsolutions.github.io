Had a nice day at Mills College taking a buss thro Burlingame, San Mateo, to San Francisco, going across the bay to Oakland. Found the College situated in picturesque spot right in the woods, the Campus is most attractive, Mary Elswig met us and showed us all over and started back after lunch at the College in, arriving back at Betty&#39;s school by 5,30, tired so went to bed early.
