We pulled into Seattle at 6-a.m. but I did not stir from my birth till all the car full of passengers had gone, then I dressed quietly and had the porter carry my bags over to the new Richmond Hotel where I registered for 24 hours. After a light breakfast I took a sight seeing buss. Seattle may well be proud of her parks seven there are and all so beautiful. We drove for three hours through woodland park along Washington Boulevard with Washington lake on one side and a combination of the natural and cultivated on the other, after which we visited the University of Washington, even more attractively situated than Stanford is reversely was. Saw the Government Building and Locks; the only Locks in the world where fresh water and salt water meet. When we reached Ballard, we got out of our car, and watched the ship come thro the Canal and the locks do their work. Wonderful are the works of man. On to the Harbor we went where five million of Cargo pass every year to the lumber yards. Then up the hills we went thro the Residential district, Washington Woodland Park covers 1800 acres of land, right in the middle is Harding’s Monument on the spot where he made his last speech. Tomorrow I say good bye to Seattle named after the Indian Seattle meaning “Charm” and well named it indeed is.
