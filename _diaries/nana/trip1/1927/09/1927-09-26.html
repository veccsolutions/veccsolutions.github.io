Started out 9-30 for Stanford University where Tindale and William are in College had a most delightful day, particularly impressed with the church, the beautiful windows, done by Tifiny in Mosaque, are reproductions of the old Master painting. We walked all about the Campus then back to the Hotel at 4-P.M.
