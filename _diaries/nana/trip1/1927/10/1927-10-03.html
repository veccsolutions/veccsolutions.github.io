When I woke up I found the ground covered with snow, and oh so cold but I jumped up and took my exercize felt fine. got a Car to take me to the Hot Springs four miles up winding mountains roads amongst the pines, oh, how fresh they smelt. had a swim, and back to the Hotel for dinner after which I started up the mountains the other way to &quot;the cave&quot; another hot springs, it was snowing hard but I enjoyed it every step, and would sit down on stumps of trees just listening to the rustle of the pines, on my way back I met a very nice English woman who was on her way around the world of course she was interesting and I learned a lot of things from her. Wrote to Harriett &amp; Lucy, and discovered the train would not be in till 12 oclock. So I sent postals to the girls maud, Tindale, Betty, Nona, Flo Hiert, Lill.
