Arrived at the North Station 7-30 A.M. phoned Martha to meet me in Malden she was not expecting me till the following day so was not at home, but George met me with a taxie and took me to the old house, 35 Lincoln St. Oh! the happy recollections this old house brought back to me of twenty five years ago when Harriett five, and Lucy 1 &#189; years old, we spent two months with Mother Robinson there, then we had our dear husband and Father to welcome us home to Telluride and to be with us in thought while away visiting his old house and Mother. many changes had come to pass since then, this old house seemed very lonely and sad, only George was here in the day time, and it was very dusty and neglected looking. However Martha who teaches in Malden High School came back and cheered us up, she is a bright girl and Robinson Martha&#39;s brother took us in his car to his home in Medford, where his dear little wife had a good dinner waiting for us. arriving back in Malden at about eleven oclock.
