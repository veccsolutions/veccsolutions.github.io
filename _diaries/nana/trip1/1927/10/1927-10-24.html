Did not get up till 9.30 had a coup of coffee and off to Church with Sidney, Hattie. Heard a sort of a sermon more of a lecture on Encouraging Church in Politics. Robinson took us all to his home for dinner a wonderful reunion dinner all done by his delightful little wife Elsie. Then we went for a long ride to Lynn &amp; etc. and home for tea at six.
