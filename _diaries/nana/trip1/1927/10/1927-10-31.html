Went to Boston visited the Art Museum, the picture that impressed most was one painted by John Singleton Copely in 1737-1815, &quot;Watson and the Shark and another by Jene Babish Carot [Jean-Baptiste-Camille Carot], &quot;Dante and Virgil&quot;, and another by Abbott Thayer, &quot;Caritas,&quot; [can be seen at: http://www.mfa.org] I had a wonderful day.
