Feeling better today still on a milk dietâ€”had my first music lesson, thrilled to death, began with MacDowells Wild Rose. Rev Black describes me as an interesting problem simply because I seem to play without being able to read one note of Music. I shall take a few lessons and try to learn, a thing I have longed to do all my life. Letter from Arvella Neagle, hope to hear from the girls tomorrow.
