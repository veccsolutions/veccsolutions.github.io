Went to church with Hattie, Sidney and Martha after which Sidney too us all out to dinner. had guests for the afternoon and tea, then I excused myself and took a long walk thro the [Fair]way[?], of course wished my girls could be with me as I picked the autumn leaves to send to them when I wrote later in the Evening. They have been my life and will be till the end, but they left me for another.
