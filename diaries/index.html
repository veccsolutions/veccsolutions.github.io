        We're fortunate that some of our ancestors have left behind more than mere breadcrumbs. Some took the time to "pickle the remains" of their lives in various forms that allow us some insight into their daily lives.

        Mary Robinson, "Nana" to her grandkids and great-grandkids, left a journal of two trips she took by train to visit friends and her in-laws in the East during the '20's and '30's.

        The Robinson's lived in Telluride 1895-1904. Pieces of their lives there were captured in the local papers, and I've compiled a digital "scrapbook" of what I could find.

        Dana Roy Logan lived in southern Illinois and moved to Kansas in the late 1800's and early 20th century. I get tired just reading about the hard work of a farmer of those days.
